This is a hacked up solution to experiment with location tracking of an Android phone which I'm going to use as an alarm for my motorcycle.

The idea is to accept incoming calls and texts from a single number to obtain location data from the phone. If the phone detects movement while the alarm is enable, it'll start sending text messages to my phone with it's current location.

TODO: track the location and detect movement :-) (hey, i'm still getting up to speed with some Android features)
